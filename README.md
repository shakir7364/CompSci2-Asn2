# Computer Science II Assignment 2
This assignment is about writing a class that describes a Car and translates its real-world functions into code.

The Car class contains three constructors, get() and set() methods to check passed values, an overloaded toString() method, and a finalize() method to decrement the static variable that keeps track of the number of Car objects instantiated.
